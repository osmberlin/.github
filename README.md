This GitHub organization hosts projects for two distinct yet related user groups: the OSM Berlin-Brandenburg Community and the OSM Verkehrswende Community.

Historically, these two communities have had significant overlap, which is reflected in some of our projects.

# [OSM Verkehrswende](https://www.osm-verkehrswende.org/)

Projects focused on improving OSM tagging, mapping, and data related to sustainable modes of transport.

# [OSM Berlin](https://www.osm-berlin.org/)

Projects primarily related to Berlin and Brandenburg, covering a wide range of topics relevant to the local community.
